The intention with this plugin is to have a file system explorer with some functionality
I was missing from other plugins. I want to be able to “sessionize” my projects so i can switch
to them quickly, also I want to be able to search for files within my project or children directories
with ease, not having to open up telescope or anything like that.

Bear that this is in a early development stage and this plugin actually does nothing.
I'll update this as I go and as soon as the plugin is usable I'll probably switch to another branch
and make updates there. lets see how it goes.

## Changelog? is this even a changelog?

This is a huge commit cuz i really wanted to have something barely working
before actually commiting anything, if you somehow find this and want to figure
out how it works feel free to do so.
